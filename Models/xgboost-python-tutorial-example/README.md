This repo saves code for the How to train XGBoost models in Python video for our YouTube channel. Please check out the video for detailed explanations. (https://youtu.be/aLOQD66Sj0g).

Welcome to How to train XGBoost models in Python tutorial. You'll build an XGBoost Classifier model with an example dataset, step-by-step.

By following this tutorial, you’ll learn:

✅What is XGBoost (vs. gradient tree boosting algorithm)
✅How to build an XGBoost model (Classifier) in Python, step-by-step:
- Step #1: Explore and prep data
- Step #2: Build a pipeline of training
- Step #3: Set up hyperparameter tuning (cross validation)
- Step #4: Train the XGBoost model
- Step #5: Evaluate the model and make predictions
- Step #6: Measure feature importance (optional)

If you want to use Python to create XGBoost models to make predictions, this practical tutorial will get you started.
